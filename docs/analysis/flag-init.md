# Why `nativeInitializeNativeFlags` reports `onFlagsFailed` and segfaults

**Status:** investigation only; nothing modified except this file, per instructions.
Disassembly against the same `libroblox.so` (Roblox for Android 2.732.1043) used by
`findings.md`, [`app-bridge.md`](app-bridge.md) and [`render-gate.md`](render-gate.md),
using `objdump`/`nm`/`readelf` plus two small scratch scripts (a direct-`call`-site
scanner and a rip-relative-`lea`-site scanner, same technique `render-gate.md` §2
used for `eglCreateWindowSurface`). Cross-checked against `native/init_params.cpp`
(read, not modified) and reproduced once against the built `cordial-load` binary
without rebuilding it, since `native/*.cpp` is being edited concurrently.

**Bottom line up front:** `nativeInitializeNativeFlags` itself is not the function
that calls `gameActivity_onFlagsFailed`. Its own disassembled body — verified in
full — constructs the `NativeFlagsInitResult` exactly as documented, iterates the
input `String[]`, and returns normally, exception-safe, no matter what is in that
array. The **only** call to `gameActivity_onFlagsFailed` anywhere in the 116 MB
binary lives in a small, separate helper reached through a completely different,
**indirectly-invoked** function that has zero direct callers in `.text` — the same
shape `render-gate.md` §2 already found for `eglCreateWindowSurface`'s trigger, and
for the same reason: something calls it through a function pointer this pass cannot
resolve statically. What *is* pinned down precisely is the gating condition on that
call, and a live, currently-wrong piece of Cordial's own code that feeds
`nativeInitializeNativeFlags` a single "flag name" that is actually Roblox's entire
22,318-flag settings document.

---

## 1. `nativeInitializeNativeFlags` builds its result exactly as documented — verified

`Java_com_roblox_client_flags_FlagJniInterface_nativeInitializeNativeFlags` sits at
file offset `0x215a0b3` in `.dynsym`, 1625 bytes up to the next export
(`nativeRegisterFFlag` at `0x215a70c`). The dex confirms the descriptor:

```
com/roblox/client/flags/FlagJniInterface.nativeInitializeNativeFlags([Ljava/lang/String;)Lcom/roblox/client/flags/NativeFlagsInitResult;
```

Every `call *0xNN(%rax)` in this function was decoded against the exact
`JNINativeInterface` layout Cordial's own libjnivm ships
(`third_party/libjnivm/include/jni.h`), counted field-by-field rather than assumed
from memory — the header has an extra `ToReflectedField` slot that a memorized
table would miss, and getting one offset wrong cascades into every later one:

| Offset | Index | Function | Confirms |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0x30` | 6 | `FindClass` | class `com/roblox/client/flags/NativeFlagsInitResult` (read from `.rodata` at `0x34b965`) |
| `0x108` | 33 | `GetMethodID` | `"<init>"` `"(I)V"` (at `0x445690`/`0x46267b`), then `"addBoolean"` `"(Ljava/lang/String;ZZ)V"` (at `0x4628cc`/`0x507da6`) |
| `0x558` | 171 | `GetArrayLength` | called on the JNI argument itself — **it is a `jarray`, not a `jstring`** |
| `0x568` | 173 | `GetObjectArrayElement` | one call per loop iteration, index `i` |
| `0x720` | 228 | `ExceptionCheck` | after each `addBoolean` call |
| `0x88` | 17 | `ExceptionClear` | called, not `FatalError` — a pending exception here is **swallowed**, not fatal |
| `0xb8` | 23 | `DeleteLocalRef` | cleans up the array element every iteration |

Control flow, verified instruction-by-instruction:

1. `FindClass("com/roblox/client/flags/NativeFlagsInitResult")`.
2. `GetMethodID(class, "<init>", "(I)V")` and `GetMethodID(class, "addBoolean",
   "(Ljava/lang/String;ZZ)V")` — matching `native/init_params.cpp`'s own
   `NativeFlagsInitResult::ctor(ENV*, jint)` and
   `addBoolean(ENV*, shared_ptr<String>, jboolean, jboolean)` hooks exactly, both
   name and descriptor. **Cordial's Java-side stub for this class is shaped
   correctly.**
3. Calls a local helper at `0x215a308` with a *global* pointer (`0x77d9298`, an
   internal engine singleton, unrelated to the JNI argument) to obtain an `int` —
   logged as `"nativeInitializeNativeFlags: flagCount = %d"` (string at `0x34b993`,
   tag `"rbx.JNIRobloxSettings"` at `0x4d0b6b`). This value becomes the constructor's
   sole `int` argument.
4. `NewObject(class, ctor, thatInt)` via a direct-call wrapper at `0x20b7658` — the
   `int` passed here is a **provider ID**, not a count of the array (see §3).
5. `GetArrayLength(env, arg3)` — **confirms the third JNI parameter is read as an
   array**, matching the dex descriptor.
6. Loop `i = 0 .. length-1`:
   - `GetObjectArrayElement(arg3, i)` → one array element (a `jstring`, per the
     descriptor).
   - A local helper (`0x20b6351`) extracts it into a small string wrapper (SSO
     inline buffer or heap-allocated, decided by a size check).
   - A local helper (`0x215a5ce`) looks that name up in an internal table (via a
     shared hash-table `find` at `0x215a48a` — the same low-level `find` also used,
     unrelated to flags, by another function this pass ran into at `0x68fab46`;
     `objdump`'s nearest-export label for it, `...FMOD_OutputAAudioHeadphonesChanged`,
     is nearest-symbol noise per `app-bridge.md` §4.1's caveat, not a real
     relationship).
   - Logs either `"nativeInitializeNativeFlags: ... %d: %s = %s"` (found, `0x3d6727`)
     or `"nativeInitializeNativeFlags: ... %d: %s not found."` (not found,
     `0x40eed1`) — **this is the log line the reproduction run below actually
     produced.**
   - `addBoolean(result, name, found, wasOverridden)`.
   - `ExceptionCheck` → if true, `ExceptionClear` (swallowed, execution continues).
   - `DeleteLocalRef` on the element, next iteration.
7. Stack-canary check, return the constructed `NativeFlagsInitResult`.

**No path through this function — including all three of its own internal, non-exported
helpers, which were disassembled in full — references the strings `"NativeHelper"` or
`"gameActivity_onFlagsFailed"`, and none of them can throw past the per-element
`ExceptionClear`.** Whatever ends up in the array, this function returns a validly
constructed result object. It is not, itself, capable of calling
`gameActivity_onFlagsFailed`, and nothing in it looks capable of segfaulting on its
own account either (SSO/heap string handling is bounds-checked; the hash lookup is a
generic `find`; the JNI calls are all standard, guarded ones).

## 2. The live bug: Cordial is passing the entire ClientSettings document as a single flag *name*

`native/init_params.cpp`'s `cordial_init_flags` (the C++ side of `cordial_init_flags`,
called from `crates/cordial-runtime/src/bin/load.rs`) contains this, **as of this
session, unedited by this investigation**:

```cpp
// The array is a list of flag *names to cache*, not a settings document.
//
// This was wrong for several iterations: passing Roblox's ClientSettings
// JSON here made the engine call addBoolean with the entire document as a
// single flag name, which is exactly what the trace showed. ...
// An empty list is therefore correct: cache nothing up front. ...
const bool have = settings_json && *settings_json;
auto arr = std::make_shared<jnivm::Array<jnivm::String>>(have ? 1 : 0);
if (have) {
    arr->Set(0, cordial::S_pub(settings_json));
}
```

The comment states the array should always be empty. **The code directly below it
does not do that** — when `--client-settings` points at a real file (as the
reproduction instructions in this task do), `have` is true and the entire file
contents become element 0 of a one-element `String[]`. This is a live discrepancy
between documented intent and actual behaviour, not a hypothesis: the reproduction
run below shows it happening.

### Reproduced

Ran the exact command given, against the already-built binary (did **not** run
`cargo build --release` first, to avoid racing the concurrent edits to
`native/*.cpp`):

```
CORDIAL_STUB_QUIET=1 timeout 100 ./target/release/cordial-load --lib-dir "$LIBDIR" \
  --apk "$APK" --client-settings /tmp/clientsettings.json --host-libc --game-activity --run 8
```

Result: **exit 139 (SIGSEGV)**, `timeout: the monitored command dumped core`. The
captured output includes:

```
[roblox] flags FAILED — the engine could not load its flag set
I/rbx.JNIRobloxSettings    nativeInitializeNativeFlags: ... 0: {"applicationSettings":{"DFFlagConsumePlatformNameOverAlternateName":"False", ... [4123 bytes, cuts off mid-JSON, no closing brace] ...
```

That second line is exactly step 6's "found"/"not found" log (§1), firing for array
index 0, whose "name" is the raw JSON text — confirming, at runtime, that the array
Cordial builds today is the one-element, whole-document array the comment says is
wrong. The line is truncated at roughly 4 KB, consistent with `__android_log_print`'s
own bounded formatting buffer (not a crash by itself — the line ends cleanly with a
newline).

**Caveat on ordering:** the `onFlagsFailed` print (via `fprintf(stderr, …)`, which
Cordial's `NativeHelper::onFlagsFailed` hook uses unbuffered) appears *before* the
`__android_log_print`-based line in the captured file, even though §1's disassembly
shows the per-element log is produced from inside `nativeInitializeNativeFlags`,
which — per §1 — cannot itself call `onFlagsFailed`. The most likely explanation is
buffering: the two log paths go through different sinks with different flush
timing, so file order does not necessarily reflect wall-clock order. Treat the
printed order as inconclusive; both facts (the call happened, the truncated-JSON
log line happened) are independently confirmed, their relative order is not.

**No usable backtrace could be obtained in this sandbox.** There is no `gdb`
installed, and `coredumpctl` (`core_pattern` is piped to `systemd-coredump`) lists
no core for this crash — its storage is not retaining dumps here (other processes'
crashes show the same `COREFILE missing`). This is worth recording so a future
session does not repeat the attempt: getting a real backtrace requires either
installing a debugger, or Cordial installing its own `SIGSEGV` handler (the
terminate-handler precedent in `native/jni_shim.cpp`, per `findings.md` §8.2, is the
right shape for this).

---

## 3. Where `gameActivity_onFlagsFailed` is actually called from — verified, with one open edge

A whole-binary scan (every rip-relative `lea` in `.text`, ~80.6 MB, checked against
its computed target — the same method `render-gate.md` §2 used for
`eglCreateWindowSurface`) for the string `"gameActivity_onFlagsFailed"` (the only
occurrence of that string in the file, at `0x40f096`) found **exactly one** site
referencing it: `0x29c931e`.

That address is inside a small, non-exported helper starting at `0x29c92eb`. Its
entire body:

```
GetMethodID(cachedClass, "gameActivity_onFlagsFailed", "()V")   ; class ref cached at 0x6eba788
CallVoidMethod(cachedInstance, thatMethodID)                     ; instance cached at 0x6eba780
```

— i.e. this is precisely the JNI call that reaches Cordial's
`NativeHelper::onFlagsFailed` hook (`native/init_params.cpp:279`). A sibling copy
seven bytes later (`0x29c937d`) is structurally identical but calls
`"gameActivity_onEngineInitialized"` instead (`0x462ada`) — both share the
`FLog::JNINativeHelper] FATAL: Java exception occurred in JNI call.` diagnostic
string (`0x40f0d3`), consistent with a generic "call this no-arg `NativeHelper`
callback, log FATAL if it throws" template instantiated per callback name.

**This `onFlagsFailed` helper has exactly one direct caller in the whole
binary**: `0x29c553c`. That call site is gated by:

```
this = <some object>                     ; entered with this in %rbx
if (this->[0x10] == null) goto skip;      // 0x29c54f4
handle = getter(this->[0x10]);            // 0x2932f40 — looks like weak_ptr::lock()
if (handle == null) goto skip;            // 0x29c550d
target = this->[0x8];
if (target != null) {
    target->[0x10] = 11;                    // marks a state/result field FAILED
    obj = target->[0x40]->[0x10]->[0x10];   // three more pointer dereferences
    report_onFlagsFailed(obj);              // 0x29c92eb — the call at 0x29c553c
}
// unconditionally: release `handle` (refcount decrement, virtual dtor if it hits 0)
```

(`skip` reaches the same release/cleanup path with no report — i.e. those two
null-checks are safety guards around an otherwise-unconditional report, not a
separate success/failure branch; whatever decided "this is the failure case"
happened earlier, outside what this pass could see.)

**The containing function (starts at `0x29c52cc`) has zero direct callers anywhere
in `.text`.** Exactly like `render-gate.md` §2's GPU-tier device-cache function, it
is reached only through an indirect call (a function pointer, `std::function`, or
virtual dispatch) that a direct-`call`-site scan cannot follow. This is the
honest edge of what this pass could establish: **what invokes this check, and
under what real-world condition `this->[0x8]` ends up non-null with state
worth marking `11`, is not determined here.**

What can be said with confidence: `this`, `this->[0x10]`, and `this->[0x8]` are
**not** Java objects and are **not** anything Cordial's JNI layer
(`NativeFlagsInitResult`, `NativeHelper`, etc.) constructs or touches — they are
private, internal C++ engine state, invisible to JNI entirely. Nothing in
`native/init_params.cpp` initialises or influences this object graph one way or
the other. If the crash is in the three-deep dereference chain
(`target->[0x40]->[0x10]->[0x10]`) immediately preceding the report call, or in
whatever indirectly invokes `0x29c52cc` at all, it would be because that internal
state was never populated the way the real Android app populates it before this
code path runs — consistent with, but not proven by, the reproduction in §2. This
is inference, not a verified fact; nailing it down needs a live debugger (§2's
caveat) or an instrumented breakpoint/wrapper at `0x29c52cc`'s entry, similar in
spirit to the libc-call wrapper technique `findings.md` §8.1 already uses.

---

## 4. `nativeRegisterJavaFlagProvider` — verified unreachable from Java in this build

`Java_com_roblox_client_flags_FlagJniInterface_nativeRegisterJavaFlagProvider` is
exported at `0x29aba7a` (57 bytes, ending well before the next export,
`MemStorage.setItem`). Checked against **all three** shipping dex files with
`tools/dex_method.py`, both restricted to the `FlagJniInterface` class and with an
unrestricted name search across every class:

```
$ python3 tools/dex_method.py apk/dex/ --class com/roblox/client/flags/FlagJniInterface
# lists 7 methods: nativeGetFFlag, nativeGetFInt, nativeGetFString,
# nativeInitializeNativeFlags, nativeRegisterFFlag, nativeRegisterFInt,
# nativeRegisterFString — no nativeRegisterJavaFlagProvider

$ python3 tools/dex_method.py apk/dex/ nativeRegisterJavaFlagProvider
no match
```

**No Java class in this shipping build declares this native method at all.** It
cannot be reached through the normal JNI static-linkage path (the
`Java_com_roblox_..._methodName` symbol convention only matters if some
`class.native(...)` declaration in the dex causes the JVM to look it up), and
nothing else in the dex calls it either. Its own body confirms it does not expect
to be called through the normal path: it takes the standard `(JNIEnv*, jclass, ...)`
JNI convention but **ignores every incoming argument** and simply:

```
GetOrRegisterProviderId(&globalProviderRegistry)   ; call 0x215a308 — the SAME
                                                     ; helper nativeInitializeNativeFlags's
                                                     ; own preamble calls (§1 step 3)
__android_log_print(INFO, "rbx.JNIRobloxSettings",
    "nativeRegisterJavaFlagProvider: Registered external flag provider from Java with ID: %d",
    result)
return result
```

The log format string (`0x4b41e6`) confirms the semantics: the shared counter at
`0x215a308` is a **provider-ID generator**, and this native is just an alternate
(unused, in this build) entry point into the same registration the constructor
step in §1 already performs inline. **Answer to the task's question: no, the flag
pipeline does not require calling it first — the real shipping app does not call
it either, and `nativeInitializeNativeFlags` already performs the equivalent
registration itself.** This rules it out as the missing piece.

---

## 5. What's verified vs inferred

**Verified** (disassembly, cross-checked against Cordial's own `jni.h` and
`native/init_params.cpp`, and against a live reproduction):
- `nativeInitializeNativeFlags`'s full body, all three of its private helpers,
  builds `NativeFlagsInitResult` exactly as Cordial's Java-side stub expects
  (§1), takes a `String[]` of flag *names* (not a document), and cannot itself
  call `onFlagsFailed` or crash on the input it's given.
- `native/init_params.cpp`'s `cordial_init_flags` currently packs the entire
  settings document as element 0 of that array when `--client-settings` is
  supplied, contradicting its own comment (§2) — reproduced live.
- The sole reference to `"gameActivity_onFlagsFailed"` in the binary, its sole
  caller, and that caller's gating logic (§3).
- `nativeRegisterJavaFlagProvider` is unreachable from Java in this dex set and
  is not a prerequisite (§4).
- The reproduction: exit 139/SIGSEGV, `onFlagsFailed` fires, the truncated
  whole-document-as-flag-name log line fires (§2).

**Inferred, not verified:**
- That the segfault is specifically the `target->[0x40]->[0x10]->[0x10]` chain in
  §3, or specifically triggered by whatever indirectly invokes `0x29c52cc`. No
  backtrace was obtainable in this sandbox (§2) to confirm the exact faulting
  instruction.
- Why `this->[0x8]` (§3) ends up non-null/marked-11 at all in Cordial's run — this
  requires knowing what real Android's flags subsystem normally does to populate
  it, which is internal engine state with no JNI-visible surface.

**Not established:**
- Whether fixing §2 (passing an empty array, as the code's own comment says it
  should) changes the outcome. Given §3's trigger looks independent of the
  array's contents — it's gated on unrelated internal engine state, not on
  anything `nativeInitializeNativeFlags` touches — there is no evidence either
  way that this fixes `onFlagsFailed`, only that it removes a confirmed,
  currently-live bug (a multi-megabyte string being hashed, logged, and searched
  for as if it were a flag name).

---

## 6. Recommendation

1. **Fix the discrepancy in `native/init_params.cpp`'s `cordial_init_flags`
   (§2) to match its own comment** — always construct a zero-length array,
   regardless of whether `settings_json` is non-empty. This is confirmed-wrong
   today and reproducibly wastes a multi-KB log line and a hash lookup on a
   string that can never be a real flag name. Low risk, because §1 shows an
   empty array makes the loop in step 6 simply not execute — the function still
   returns a validly constructed (if empty) `NativeFlagsInitResult`.
2. **Do not add a call to `nativeRegisterJavaFlagProvider`** — §4 shows it is
   unreachable in the real app and redundant with what
   `nativeInitializeNativeFlags` already does internally.
3. **Fix #1 is very unlikely to be sufficient on its own.** §3's trigger for
   `onFlagsFailed` is gated on internal engine object state
   (`this->[0x10]`, `this->[0x8]`) that has nothing to do with the JNI array
   argument — it is reached through an indirect call this pass could not
   resolve. Expect `onFlagsFailed` (and possibly the segfault) to persist after
   fix #1, unless it happens to be timing-sensitive in a way that an empty,
   fast-returning array changes.
4. **The highest-leverage next step is a working debugger or core-dump
   pipeline in this environment** — there is no `gdb` here and
   `systemd-coredump` is not retaining dumps (§2). Without a backtrace, closing
   §3's open edge (what calls `0x29c52cc`, and what exactly is null/dangling at
   the crash) requires either an external debugger, or an instrumented
   breakpoint/wrapper at `0x29c52cc`'s entry — printing `this`, `this->[0x10]`,
   and `this->[0x8]` at runtime, the same wrapper-based instrumentation
   technique `findings.md` §8.1 already used successfully for libc calls.

---

## 7. Follow-up session: `lldb` is available now, and it found a second, real bug

`lldb` (`/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/lldb`) turned out to be present in this
environment (§6's blocker assumed it was not). With `settings set
target.disable-aslr true`, `libroblox.so` loads at a fixed address every run
(`0x7fffefec0000` under the task's exact repro invocation), which makes raw
breakpoint addresses reproducible run to run. This section only reports what
was confirmed by breaking and inspecting live state — per this project's own
hard-won lesson, static disassembly alone has repeatedly produced wrong
conclusions here (see §3 below for a concrete instance of exactly that).

### 7.1 The real, fixed bug: `NativeFlagsInitResult`'s constructor was never reachable

`native/init_params.cpp` registered `NativeFlagsInitResult`'s constructor with:

```cpp
c->HookInstanceFunction(env, "<init>", &NativeFlagsInitResult::ctor);
```

This looks right, and §1's disassembly (`GetMethodID(class, "<init>", "(I)V")`
then `NewObject`) looks like it should call it. **It never did.** The live JNI
trace (`JNI_TRACE` build of `third_party/libjnivm`) showed, on every run before
this fix:

```
[JNIVM]: Constructed Unresolved symbol, Class=`NativeFlagsInitResult`,
    StaticMethod=`<init>`, Signature=`(I)Lcom/roblox/client/flags/NativeFlagsInitResult;`
[JNIVM]: Call Unknown Static Function Class=`NativeFlagsInitResult` Method=`<init>` ...
```

i.e. libjnivm was looking for a **static** method literally named `<init>`
whose signature has the **return type folded in**, not the instance
constructor Cordial registered. The cause is in libjnivm itself
(`third_party/libjnivm/src/jnivm/internal/method.cpp:13-24`,
`jnivm::GetMethodID`):

```cpp
// Rewrite init to Static external function
if(!isStatic && sname == "<init>") {
    // strips everything after ')', appends "L<nativeprefix>;"
    return GetMethodID<true, ReturnNull, AllowNative, trace>(env, cl, str0, ssig.data());
}
```

Every *instance* `GetMethodID(cls, "<init>", sig)` call is unconditionally
rewritten into a **static** lookup with signature `sig-up-to-')'` +
`"L" + nativeprefix + ";"`. So `GetMethodID(class, "<init>", "(I)V")` actually
resolves against `("<init>", "(I)Lcom/roblox/client/flags/NativeFlagsInitResult;")`,
static. `HookInstanceFunction` can never register a match for that lookup —
it registers an *instance* method with the *original* signature. The engine
got back an auto-synthesized unresolved-symbol stub (which `defaultVal<jobject>`
makes return null), called it, and treated the null/degenerate result as a
reason to report `onFlagsFailed`.

This is not specific to `NativeFlagsInitResult` — it is true of *every*
`<init>` this codebase registers via a real `NewObject`/`GetMethodID` path from
the engine's side. It happened not to matter elsewhere because every other
class in `native/init_params.cpp` is constructed by *Cordial's own C++ code*
calling a `Create()` factory directly (never through JNI dispatch), so the
libjnivm rewrite was never exercised for them. `NativeFlagsInitResult` is
the one class the *engine itself* constructs via `NewObject`, which is exactly
why this only showed up here.

**Fix applied:** register the constructor the same way this file's own
`Create()` factories are shaped — as a plain **static** function taking
`(ENV*, Class*, jint)` and returning `std::shared_ptr<NativeFlagsInitResult>`,
via `c->Hook(env, "<init>", &NativeFlagsInitResult::ctor)` (not
`HookInstanceFunction`). `Class::Hook` auto-detects "static" from the
parameter types (second parameter `Class*`, not `Object*`/`jobject`), and its
derived signature is exactly `"(I)L<nativeprefix>;"` — matching libjnivm's
rewritten lookup. Confirmed live: the trace now reads
`Found symbol ... StaticMethod=\`<init>\`` and
`Call Static Function ... Method=\`<init>\`` (not "Unresolved"/"Unknown") —
the constructor genuinely runs now, `NativeFlagsInitResult` is built with a
real backing `JavaMap`, and its return value is a valid, non-null object
reaching the caller. **`gameActivity_onFlagsFailed` still fires afterward
(see §7.3) — this fix was necessary but not sufficient**, exactly as §6.3
warned.

Also fixed in the same pass: §2's confirmed live bug (the whole ClientSettings
document being packed as a single array element) — `cordial_init_flags` now
always builds a zero-length array, matching its own comment, regardless of
whether `--client-settings` is set.

### 7.2 `com.roblox.engine.jni.model.ClientLocalFlags` implemented; `readLocalFlags()` called

A second investigation thread (a parallel review of the render/network path)
found that `NativeGLInterface.readLocalFlags()` — `()Lcom/roblox/engine/jni/
model/ClientLocalFlags;`, exported at `Java_com_roblox_engine_jni_
NativeGLInterface_readLocalFlags` — is the engine's *offline* counterpart to
fetching `ClientSettings` over the network: it reads whatever bundled/cached
flag defaults the engine has and hands them back via the same `new` +
repeated `add(name, value)` idiom `nativeInitializeNativeFlags` uses for its
own result object. Nothing in the shipping dex calls it on the
`ActivityNativeMain` chain Cordial drives (dex xref: its only caller is a
different startup path), so it was entirely dead code here, and its Java
counterpart class was completely unimplemented.

Implemented `ClientLocalFlags` (dex-verified shape: `<init>()V`,
`add(String,String)V`, `getAll()Lorg/json/JSONObject;`, `isEmpty()Z`,
`size()I`) plus a minimal `org.json.JSONObject` stub, using the same
static-factory `<init>` registration §7.1 established is required. Wired a
`cordial_read_local_flags` bridge and call it right after
`nativeInitializeNativeFlags`. **Result: it runs cleanly (no crash, no
unresolved-symbol noise) but calls `add()` zero times** — this build has no
bundled local flag defaults on disk, so the engine constructs an empty
`ClientLocalFlags` and returns. `onFlagsFailed` is unaffected.

### 7.3 The real trigger: `onFlagsFailed` fires from an unrelated background thread, confirmed by breakpoint

§3's static disassembly identified a single, specific address
(`libroblox+0x29c92eb`) as "the helper that calls `gameActivity_
onFlagsFailed`", reached from one caller at `libroblox+0x29c553c`. **Both
addresses were placed as raw hardware breakpoints and neither one was ever
hit before the process crashed** — even though, in the same run without those
breakpoints, `onFlagsFailed` demonstrably fired (Cordial's own hook printed
`[roblox] flags FAILED`). This is exactly the kind of static-analysis error
the top of this file warns about: the string-reference scan found *a*
call site for the string `"gameActivity_onFlagsFailed"`, but not necessarily
*the* one actually exercised at runtime by this code path.

Breaking instead on Cordial's own hook —
`cordial::NativeHelper::onFlagsFailed` (a real symbol in `cordial-load`,
`nm`-verified, so no address guessing needed) — hits reliably, and its
backtrace is unambiguous:

```
frame #0  cordial::NativeHelper::onFlagsFailed
frame #1  jnivm::Wrap<...>::InstanceInvoke
frame #2  jnivm::MDispatchBase2<void>::CallMethod
frame #3  jnivm::MDispatchBase<void,jobject*>::CallMethod(..., va_list)
frame #4  libroblox+0x68a6fe3
frame #5  libroblox+0x29c8fff
frame #6  libroblox+0x29c9349
frame #7  libroblox+0x29c5541      <- return addr; matches §3's claimed
                                       call site (0x29c553c) + 5 bytes exactly
frame #8-10  libroblox (+0x1f9b850, +0x1f9b728, +0x1f9b5a7)
frame #11 libc.so.6`start_thread + 921
frame #12 libc.so.6`__clone3 + 44
```

**This call happens on a separate `pthread`, spawned via `start_thread`/
`__clone3` — not on the thread that runs Cordial's sequential bring-up code
(`nativeInitializeNativeFlags`, `readLocalFlags`, `nativeInitClientSettings`,
etc. all run on the "calling" thread; this backtrace contains none of those
frames).** §3's outer-caller address (frame #7, `0x29c553c`) is confirmed
correct — the return address matches exactly — but §3's claim that the
`onFlagsFailed`-reporting helper itself lives at `0x29c92eb` is off by one
level of the call chain (frame #6 is closer to that address; the actual
`GetMethodID`+`CallVoidMethod` pair is one level deeper, around
`0x29c8fxx`/frame #5). More importantly: **this whole chain runs
independently of, and after, whatever Cordial's own thread has done.**

This was confirmed empirically, not just from one backtrace: `onFlagsFailed`
fires with the *identical* character (same log line, same async-thread
backtrace shape) across every combination tried in this session —
`nativeInitializeNativeFlags` called with an empty array (correct) or the
old buggy whole-document array; `readLocalFlags` called or not; and
`nativeInitClientSettings` (§7.4) called with a real `ClientSettings`
document, with all-empty arguments, or not called at all. **Nothing this
session found how to influence changes whether or when `onFlagsFailed`
fires.** That is consistent with §3's original conclusion — the trigger is
gated on internal engine state this pass could not identify the origin of —
now confirmed live rather than inferred from disassembly alone.

### 7.4 `nativeInitClientSettings` / `nativePostClientSettingsLoadedInitialization3` — wired, with one new hazard found

Per the architecture Roblox ships: these `NativeGLInterface` natives are not
the engine asking Cordial for settings over JNI — they are the interface a
**host app** uses to hand the engine settings *it* already fetched. Cordial
is the host app here, so calling these directly (with real data, no forged
HTTP responses) is the legitimate interface, not a workaround. Dex-verified
descriptors:

```
nativeInitClientSettings(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)I
nativeInitClientSettingsSigned(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)I
nativeInitClientSettingsCached(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;J)I
nativePostClientSettingsLoadedInitialization3(Ljava/util/List;)V
```

Implemented `cordial_init_client_settings` (unsigned variant only — deliberately
not touching `...Signed`, since forging a signature would misrepresent real
account/server state) and called it with the real `--client-settings` document
in the middle argument, empty strings for the other two (their exact roles
were not determined — see below). **It returns `1` — but that value is
*not* a validation result**: it returns exactly `1` for every combination
tried, including all three arguments empty. That is strong evidence the
`int` is a synchronous request handle/"accepted for async processing" code,
not a success/failure flag — consistent with §7.3's finding that the actual
accept/reject decision happens later, on a different thread.

**A new, real hazard found and *not* shipped enabled:**
`nativePostClientSettingsLoadedInitialization3(List)`, called with an empty
`java.util.ArrayList` (a new minimal `JavaList` stub, same static-factory
`<init>` pattern), **crashes synchronously, immediately, on the calling
thread** — verified live under `lldb`: `SIGSEGV`, fault address `0x8`, inside
`libc.so.6\`_IO_fflush`, called from inside the engine's own implementation
of this native. This is a *worse* regression than the pre-existing
asynchronous crash (§3's `libroblox+0x2ccd937`, `SingleSurfaceAppImpl`'s null
`JNIEnv`) — it happens earlier, synchronously, and on Cordial's own thread
instead of an engine-internal one. **The call is implemented (`cordial_
post_client_settings_loaded` / `game_activity::post_client_settings_loaded`)
but gated behind `CORDIAL_TRY_POST_CLIENT_SETTINGS=1` and not run by
default** — an empty list is evidently not what this native expects, and
guessing further was not attempted this session (time-boxed). Whatever real
list contents it wants remain undetermined.

With `nativePostClientSettingsLoadedInitialization3` disabled, the crash
reverts to the original, unrelated `0x2ccd937` (confirmed via the same
breakpoint-on-`onFlagsFailed`-and-`continue` technique) — i.e. §7.4's changes,
as shipped, introduce no new crash.

### 7.5 `nativePreloadFlagOverrides` — a second real bug found, format still undetermined

`--flag-overrides <f>` was **parsed but never wired to any native call at
all** before this session — `opt.flag_overrides` existed as a CLI field with
no corresponding call anywhere in `native/init_params.cpp` or `load.rs`. That
fully explains §3's original "no extra logging" result: nothing was ever
invoked. A `cordial_preload_flag_overrides` bridge (dex-verified descriptor
`MainGameActivity.nativePreloadFlagOverrides(Ljava/lang/String;)V`, an
*instance* native — second JNI argument is an Activity object, following
`cordial_set_init_params`'s precedent of a bare placeholder `jnivm::Object`)
is now wired and called with the file's raw contents.

A second bug was caught in the same pass, while fixing the first: an initial
version of the wiring re-read `opt.flag_overrides` **as if it were a file
path** — but the option parser (`--flag-overrides` in `load.rs`'s argument
loop) already reads the file at parse time and stores its *contents*, not
its path. That re-read silently failed and passed an **empty string**
through. Fixed to use the stored content directly; confirmed by checking the
transmitted byte count matches the source file's size exactly.

**With the call now genuinely delivering real bytes, still no observable
effect was found**: tried a flat `{"FLogChannelName":"7", ...}` map (the
shape suggested by the FLog-channel hypothesis in §3/crash-trace.md) — no new
log lines, no change to the flags verdict or crash. **The correct JSON shape
for this native remains undetermined.** What is now known for certain: the
call itself is reachable and does not throw or crash with a small flat JSON
object as input. Candidates not yet tried: the doubly-wrapped
`{"applicationSettings":{...}}` shape the real `clientsettings.roblox.com`
response uses (same shape as `/tmp/clientsettings.json`, which is ~1.2MB —
worth trying whole, since "preload" suggests it may want the same document
`nativeInitClientSettings` takes); a JSON array of flag names (mirroring
`nativeInitializeNativeFlags`'s actual argument shape); or no JSON at all
(a newline-separated list, as this file's own `--client-settings` help text
describes for a *different*, unrelated option, which may be a hint about the
project's own earlier assumptions rather than the engine's real expectation).

### 7.6 Summary: what changed, what didn't

**Fixed, verified live:**
- `NativeFlagsInitResult`'s constructor now actually runs (§7.1) — this was a
  real, confirmed bug (unreachable native constructor), not a hypothesis.
- `cordial_init_flags` no longer packs the whole ClientSettings document as a
  single array element (§7.1, closing §2/§6.1).
- `readLocalFlags()` / `ClientLocalFlags` implemented and called (§7.2) —
  runs cleanly, contributes nothing (no bundled local defaults in this build).
- `nativeInitClientSettings` implemented and called with the real
  `ClientSettings` document (§7.4) — runs cleanly, returns `1` (an accept
  code, not validation) regardless of payload.
- `--flag-overrides` is now actually wired to `nativePreloadFlagOverrides`
  and delivers real bytes (§7.5) — it was previously a dead CLI option.
- A new synchronous crash (`nativePostClientSettingsLoadedInitialization3`
  with an empty `ArrayList`) was found and **not** shipped enabled (§7.4).

**Not fixed — honest negative result:** `gameActivity_onFlagsFailed` still
fires. It is confirmed, by breakpoint (not inference), to run on a separate
pthread whose creation and decision-making this session could not trace back
to any Cordial-controlled input — every synchronous call this session added
or removed left its behaviour identical. The condition that "chooses failure
over success" is internal engine state on that background thread, still not
identified. The highest-leverage next step is the same as §6.4 named:
tracing what spawns that pthread (breakpoint on `pthread_create`, or on the
`start_thread` return addresses seen in §7.3's backtrace, `libroblox+
0x1f9b5a7`/`+0x1f9b728`/`+0x1f9b850`, to find where that thread's *own*
entry point is, not just its later call stack).

## §8. Client settings are not what the flags verdict depends on

Cordial now fetches Roblox's real client-settings document and the engine accepts
it: `nativeInitClientSettings` returns `0`, and
`nativePostClientSettingsLoadedInitialization3` then succeeds. (That call used to
crash synchronously in `_IO_fflush`; the crash was a *consequence* of the
settings not being accepted, not a bad `List`, and it went away on its own once
`nativeInitClientSettings` started returning `0`. It is now unconditional.)

The verdict is still `onFlagsFailed`.

Three orderings were tried, each strictly earlier than the last:

| when the settings are delivered | result |
|---|---|
| after the flag calls (original) | `flags FAILED` before the call |
| before the flag calls | `flags FAILED` still first |
| **before `initializeNativeCode`** — `-> 0` | `flags FAILED` unchanged |

The third is the decisive one. The settings are parsed and accepted before the
engine's own bring-up even starts, and the verdict does not move. So this is not
a race that a better ordering can win, and **the flags verdict does not depend on
the client-settings document.**

That is worth stating plainly because two independent investigations converged on
client settings as the likely root cause of `onFlagsFailed`, and the reasoning
was good: flags *are* client settings, the document really was missing, and the
fetch really was never happening. It was still wrong. The work it produced is
real — the CA bundle, the asset folder, the fetch, the call contract — but none
of it is the answer to this question.

What remains unexplained: `onFlagsFailed` arrives on a background thread, early,
with a full and valid flag set already installed. Whatever it is testing, it is
not "do I have flags".
