# Does a focused Roblox TextBox get an editor, in the right place, with the
# characters in it?
#
# This exists because the answer changed three times in one session and each
# time the evidence was a hand-driven run that was hard to repeat. Typing into a
# box is a five-step dance -- launch, wait for the app shell, click the box,
# type, photograph the composited result -- and four of those five steps have
# their own way of silently not happening:
#
#   * fixed `sleep`s race the app shell. Four runs were read as "the click
#     missed the button" when the page simply had not rendered yet. This polls
#     the log for readiness instead.
#   * `CORDIAL_SCRIPT` parses and never fires unless `CORDIAL_INSTR=1` is also
#     set. That cost four more runs.
#   * `cordial_screenshot` reads the engine's own swapchain and cannot see a GTK
#     editor at all, so it reports success whatever happens. `grim` against the
#     nested compositor is the only capture that proves anything here.
#   * a client left over from a previous run holds the profile lock, and the
#     refusal reads as a launch failure.
#
# What it asserts, in order, so a failure says which step broke:
#
#   1. the app shell reaches a screen that has a search box
#   2. clicking it focuses a TextBox
#   3. `showKeyboard` delivers a NativeTextBoxInfo -- not null, and not zeroed
#   4. the characters reach the engine
#   5. a composited screenshot exists to look at
#
# Step 3 is the one worth having. It was null for the entire life of this
# project because the `<init>` hook was one argument short of the dex signature,
# and nothing noticed because a null spec and a spec nobody asked for look
# identical from outside.
#
# Usage:  tools/text-entry-check.sh [profile] [text]
# Needs:  a signed-in profile, `cage` and `grim` in the container, and a build.
