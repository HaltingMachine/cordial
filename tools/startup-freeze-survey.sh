# One launch of the client, with no input at all, measured. Prints one TSV row.
#
# This exists because the startup freeze is a race and every conclusion drawn
# about it from a handful of launches has been wrong. Measured on 2026-08-25
# over twenty-five launches of one signed-in profile: **eight frozen, seventeen
# healthy**. At a 32% base rate, three runs agreeing happens about one time in
# thirty, and this bug has twice been "reliably reproduced" and twice been
# something else. Do not believe a change to it on fewer than about twenty runs
# in each arm.
#
#   tools/startup-freeze-survey.sh <run-number> [profile]
#
# Columns:
#
# **2026-08-26, and this is the finding to start from: the freeze is a
# signed-in phenomenon.** Twenty runs on a signed-in profile froze SIXTEEN
# times. Forty runs earlier the same evening on a signed-out one froze not
# once. Same machine, same binary, same hour.
#
#     signed in  (ready=RootSwitchNavigator)   16 / 20 frozen   80%
#     signed out (ready=Landing)                0 / 40 frozen    0%
#
# A frozen signed-in run stops almost immediately -- presents of 1, 2, 4 and 7
# at ten seconds and unchanged at twenty-five -- against about 320 for a
# healthy one. There is no ambiguity in the reading and no need for statistics
# to separate the arms.
#
# **So every measurement taken on a signed-out profile is about something
# else**, including the twenty-per-arm nudge experiment recorded below, which
# concluded nothing because nothing froze. That was not bad luck. Sign in
# before measuring this bug.
#
# It also turns an intermittent bug into a reproducible one. At 80% a frozen
# client is two launches away, which makes catching one under gdb -- with
# `cordial_loopers` for the descriptor counts and the process CPU beside the
# stacks -- a matter of minutes rather than a day of waiting.
#
# **2026-08-26 (earlier): forty runs, twenty per arm, and not one freeze.** Nudged versus
# not, strictly interleaved, on this machine after a reboot. At the 32% base
# rate above you would expect about thirteen; the chance of none is about three
# in ten million. So the freeze did not reproduce at all that day, and the arm
# that was supposed to test it could not be judged -- you cannot measure whether
# input prevents a freeze when nothing freezes.
#
# The nudge instrument was live this time, which is the part worth keeping. The
# previous NUDGE arm was a silent no-op: the virtual pointer holder was started
# after the client had already latched seat capabilities at open(), so nothing
# was ever delivered and the arm measured nothing at all. This one drove
# Cordial's own entry points through the MCP instead and recorded proof --
# `first_ok_move_at=0.017 ok=1710 errreply=0` per run. It also had a visible
# effect on something: nudged runs sit at a p25 median of 3578 presents against
# 2838, which is the idle throttle being held off, exactly as it should be.
#
# What that leaves is an open question rather than an answer. Either the freeze
# has been fixed by something committed since 2026-08-25, or its conditions
# differ from this harness. Note that every run here reached `Landing` -- the
# signed-out screen -- while the original 25-run measurement was taken on a
# signed-in profile. **Before spending another day on the freeze, re-run this
# on a signed-in profile that reaches a game**, because a bug that only appears
# past the login screen would look exactly like this.
#
#   run         the number you passed, so rows collate
#   ready       the last `app ready:` screen the shell reached
#   presents10  vkQueuePresentKHR count ten seconds after that
#   presents25  the same fifteen seconds later
#   cookies     how many domains the saved session restored
#   verdict     FROZEN when the count stopped climbing and stayed under ten
#   stage       the last `StartupController started: stage` the ENGINE logged
#
# **No input is driven, deliberately.** The freeze is reported as happening when
# nobody touches the client while it loads, so touching it measures something
# else -- and a run that was nudged is not comparable with one that was not.
#
# `presents=1` is the usual frozen reading but not the only one: the survey saw
# 0, 1 and 5. Read the count, not the verdict, when a row looks odd.
#
# Set `CORDIAL_POLL_COALESCE_US=0` to run the looper's idle backoff off as a
# control, `CORDIAL_BRIDGE_DELAY_MS=<n>` to hold the app bridge back before it
# starts the Lua app, and `TAG=<word>` to keep one arm's logs from overwriting
# another's.
#
# `LOAD=<n>` runs n busy loops for the duration of the launch. **Suspect the
# machine before the code here:** eight consecutive launches on an otherwise
# idle machine came back healthy, against a third frozen measured earlier the
# same evening while builds and greps were running alongside. That is not proof
# of anything yet, but it means the first two arms of this survey compared code
# while the load differed, and neither of them is safe to quote.
#
# `NUDGE=1` drives real pointer motion through the nested compositor from the
# moment the client starts until the shell is ready. That is the one arm that
# is *not* a clean measurement of the bug -- it is a measurement of the user's
# own report, which is that giving the client input while it loads stops it
# freezing. It has never been tested. It is not a fix and must not become one:
# see AGENTS.md on synthesising input, and note this only ever happens inside
# the harness's own compositor.
