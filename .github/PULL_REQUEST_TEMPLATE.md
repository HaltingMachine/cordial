## What this changes

## What you measured

Cordial's rule is that claims are worth what they were measured with. This
project has a documented history of confident wrong conclusions drawn from
reading the binary instead of running it — `docs/NEXT.md` keeps the list so
nobody repeats them.

So: what did you run, and what did it print? Paste it. "Should work" and "builds
cleanly" are not measurements.

- [ ] `cargo test --workspace` passes
- [ ] `cargo build --release` is warning-clean for the code I touched
- [ ] the client still launches — repeatedly, not once

## Anything you disproved

If you found that something already written down is wrong — in a comment, in
`docs/NEXT.md`, in an ADR — say so here. Several commits in this repository exist
only to retract an earlier claim, and that is the highest-value thing a change
can carry.

## Scope check

- [ ] No in-process hooking, script execution, or memory access is added
- [ ] Nothing here came from a decompiler, and no Roblox code, assets or APK
      contents are included
- [ ] If this adds a plugin capability, it exposes an *effect* and not a channel
      ([ADR-007](../docs/adr/ADR-007-host-resources-are-brokered.md))
- [ ] If this contradicts an ADR, the ADR is updated in the same change rather
      than left stale

## For maintainers testing this

Do not use an account you care about, and put the test account on a different IP
— see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md). The risk is collateral rather than
causal, and it is not worth taking with your main.
