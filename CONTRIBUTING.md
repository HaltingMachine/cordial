# Contributing to Cordial

Cordial is a runtime for a 116 MB stripped binary nobody here has the source to.
That shapes everything about how work gets done on it, and this document is
mostly about that method rather than about code style.

Read [`docs/NEXT.md`](docs/NEXT.md) first. It is written for someone picking the
project up cold and says what is blocking, what has been tried, and — the part
that matters most — what has been **disproved**.

## The one rule

**Grep the trace before disassembling anything.**

`docs/traces/` holds a logcat capture of the same Roblox APK running on real
Android. When a question comes up about what the engine expects, that capture is
a lookup, not an investigation.

This is not a stylistic preference. Over one long session, **nine consecutive
conclusions drawn from reading the stripped binary were wrong**, and every
conclusion drawn from running something held up. The capture exists so that
never has to happen again.

## Verify by running

A claim about this engine is worth what it was measured with.

- If you cannot test a claim, **label it `INFERRED`** and say so, in the code
  comment and in the pull request. That is a perfectly acceptable state for a
  finding to be in. Presenting it as established is not.
- Timing and stability claims need **repetition**. "It works now" after one run
  is not a result — one bug in this project's history reproduced on roughly one
  launch in three, and its rate moved with machine load.
- Use a **control**. The flag override mechanism was only confirmed by showing a
  log line disappears with the flag set and is present without it, in the same
  session. A change that appears to work is not the same as a change that works.

## Record what you disproved

Half of `docs/NEXT.md` is a list of explanations that turned out to be wrong.
That is deliberate and it is the highest-value thing you can contribute.

When you rule something out, write it down with the evidence. It stops the next
person spending a day on it, and it is why several sections of this repository
read like a lab notebook. Commit messages here are long for the same reason —
they record what was measured, not just what changed.

If you find that something already written down is wrong, **say so plainly and
correct it**. Several commits in this history exist only to retract an earlier
claim. That is a healthy thing for a project like this, not an embarrassment.

## Reading the engine

Roblox narrates itself. The single best diagnostic in the project is the
engine's own log:

```
<files>/appData/logs/<version>_<timestamp>_Player_*.log
```

It names subsystems, stages, file paths and exceptions in Roblox's own words.
Read the newest one before forming a theory. Most questions are answered there
and nobody finds it on their own, which is why it is mentioned three times in
this repository.

Useful switches:

| | |
|---|---|
| `CORDIAL_ANDROID_TRACE=1` | every Android API call Cordial serves |
| `CORDIAL_TRACE_PATHS=1` | every path-taking libc call, with thread id |
| `CORDIAL_COUNT_GL=1` | graphics call counts on exit |
| `CORDIAL_MONITOR=<n>` | open the window on another monitor |

`CORDIAL_TRACE=1` is **ABI-unsafe** — it wraps variadic functions with
fixed-arity declarations and makes the engine abort. It cannot answer "which
path?" questions; `CORDIAL_TRACE_PATHS=1` can.

## Debugging facts that cost real time to learn

- **lldb breakpoints inside `libroblox.so` do not work, and fail silently.**
  Cordial `mmap`s it outside the system linker, so lldb never lists the image and
  every breakpoint stays unresolved with hit count 0. The working technique is
  `memory write` of `0xCC`, then rewinding `$pc` and restoring the byte on trap.
  Crash-stop backtraces and breakpoints in Cordial's own code are unaffected.
- **Read syscall arguments from `/proc/<pid>/task/<tid>/syscall`** while lldb has
  the process stopped, rather than from registers. It gives the number and all
  six arguments with no guesswork about the libc wrapper's register shuffling.
- **There are three threads named `Main`.** Use `thread backtrace all`.
- lldb is at `/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/lldb`. There is no gdb and no
  strace.

## Things that are permanently out of scope

**No in-process code execution against the Roblox process.** No hooking, no
memory patching, no injected script environment, and no API by which a plugin
could request one. Not disabled — *absent*, so there is no primitive in the
binary to extract or re-enable in a fork. See
[ADR-001](docs/adr/ADR-001-in-process-hooking.md).

**We do not endorse exploiting.** Pull requests adding an executor, or anything
of that shape, will be declined.

Asset overlays used to be on this list, on the reasoning that replacing a texture
is the mechanism behind wallhacks. That reasoning did not survive checking — a
Roblox part is geometry with a `BasePart` colour and material, so a transparent
material texture gives a differently shaded surface rather than a see-through
one, and both Sober and Bloxstrap ship exactly this feature in the open. They are
now supported, non-destructively and off by default: see
[ADR-010](docs/adr/ADR-010-plugin-asset-overlays.md), which supersedes
[ADR-004](docs/adr/ADR-004-plugin-asset-overrides.md). What remains refused is
in-process injection, which is a different primitive.

Also out: client-side integrity flags or watermarks, and
obfuscation-as-security.

## No Roblox code, ever

Cordial ships no Roblox code, APK, asset or decompiled material, and never will.
Do not commit any, do not vendor any, and do not paste decompiler output into an
issue or a comment.

Observing a running binary is fine and is how nearly everything here was
established — call order, load order, argument shapes, syscalls, timing.
Transcribing a decompilation of how it implements something is not. The line is
not the tool, it is what you take away.

## Do not test with your main account

Use a throwaway account, and put it on a different IP from the one your real
account uses — a VPN is the easy way.

This is not because Cordial does anything bannable. It runs the official build,
does not touch the engine's process, and asset overlays are the same thing
Bloxstrap and Sober already do in the open. The risk is collateral, not causal:
enforcement at this scale is automated, it runs in waves, and accounts that share
an address get associated with each other. If a test account is ever caught in a
wave — for any reason, including one that has nothing to do with Cordial — you do
not want the account you actually care about sitting next to it.

Cordial cannot make that decision for you and does not try to hide anything from
anyone. Testing pre-release software that loads a game client is simply not
something to do on an account you would be upset to lose.

The same goes for reporting: if you hit an account problem while testing, say so
in the issue. A ban that turns out to be Cordial's fault is the single most
important bug this project could have, and it is only findable if people mention
it.

## Practical

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/luohoa97/cordial
cd cordial
cargo build --release      # Clang required; AOSP bionic does not build with GCC
cargo test --release
```

Before opening a pull request:

- `cargo test --release` passes
- `cargo build --release` is warning-clean for code you touched
- the client still launches — repeatedly, not once
- your commit message says what you **measured**, not just what you changed

## A note on how this was built

Most of this repository was written by Claude (Anthropic) working with a human
directing the architecture. That is disclosed in the README and it is relevant
to you as a contributor: the code is real and the findings were verified by
running things, but **no human has reviewed every line**. Review accordingly, and
if you find something wrong, the project would rather hear it than not.
