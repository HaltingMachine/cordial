// Discord Presence — a first-party plugin, not a special case.
//
// It listens for client lifecycle events and keeps Discord Rich Presence in
// step with them: presence.set on launch and ready, presence.clear on
// shutdown. It requests lifecycle.read and presence.set like any third-party
// plugin would, and is granted them the same way — see ADR-006's "first-party
// plugins are still plugins": nothing here is special-cased into core.
//
// Note what it does not do. It never learns where Discord's IPC socket is,
// never opens it, and cannot send anything down it except the presence
// payload built below — Cordial owns the connection (ADR-007). It also runs
// with no Deno permissions at all, the same as every other plugin, so none of
// that containment depends on this file behaving.
//
// Two honest limitations, stated rather than hidden:
//
// - `CLIENT_ID` below is a placeholder, not a real registered Discord
//   application id. Presence will not carry Cordial's real name or icon in
//   Discord's UI until someone registers an application at
//   https://discord.com/developers/applications and this constant is
//   updated. `presence.set` will still work end-to-end with the placeholder
//   — Discord's IPC only refuses a client_id it cannot look up as an
//   application, it does not refuse for the id merely being unfamiliar.
// - `push_lifecycle`'s payload is currently empty (see host.rs): Cordial
//   does not yet thread which game or place is running through to the
//   lifecycle push, because that lives in cordial-runtime and this plugin
//   was built without touching it. The `details`/`state` text below is
//   therefore generic ("Using Cordial") rather than naming the game, and
//   should be revisited once the runtime side carries real place data.
