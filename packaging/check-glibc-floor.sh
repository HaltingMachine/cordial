# **This exists because one line cost a whole release.** `native/opensles.cpp`
# computed a millibel volume with `std::log10` on a `float`. glibc 2.43 added a
# correctly-rounded `log10f` and made it the *default* binding, so building on a
# 2.43 host emitted `log10f@GLIBC_2.43` -- the only symbol in either binary
# above 2.39 -- and the `.rpm` then refused to install anywhere older with
#
#     nothing provides libm.so.6(GLIBC_2.43)(64bit) needed by cordial-0.10.0
#
# The AppImage had it too, and that one bundles no libc at all, so the format
# whose whole purpose is running anywhere would have run on Fedora 44 and
# nothing else. Nobody noticed because every builder and every developer
# machine was newer than every user.
#
# A version bump in a build container is invisible in a diff, arrives without
# anybody changing a line, and breaks only for people who are not in the room.
# That is exactly the class of thing worth a check rather than a habit.

  cat >&2 <<'WHY'

A symbol above the floor makes the .rpm uninstallable and the AppImage
unportable. Two ways out, in order of preference:

  1. Stop using the symbol. It is usually one call, and usually a float
     variant of a maths function whose double version has been GLIBC_2.2.5
     since forever -- `log10f` was exactly that.
  2. Build in a container whose glibc is the floor, so the compiler binds to
     the older version node.

Do not raise CORDIAL_GLIBC_FLOOR to make this pass.
