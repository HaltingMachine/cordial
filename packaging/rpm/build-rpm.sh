# Build a binary RPM for Cordial: the SRPM from make-srpm.sh, then rpmbuild
# against it.
#
# make-srpm.sh already does the hard, reproducibility-sensitive part -- the
# tarball, the `cargo vendor` tree and a spec stamped with a matching
# %describe -- and stops at `rpmbuild -bs`, because that is as far as a Copr
# build needs it to go; Copr's own builders take the SRPM from there. This
# script is the other half, for producing a downloadable .rpm directly: it
# adds nothing to the spec, it just runs it.
#
# Usage:
#     packaging/rpm/build-rpm.sh [--outdir DIR]
#
# Needs everything make-srpm.sh needs (git, cargo, rpmbuild, zstd), plus
# whatever the spec's own BuildRequires ask for. Deliberately not listed
# again here: `dnf builddep` reads that list from the SRPM itself once it
# exists, which is one source of truth rather than two that can drift --
# see .github/workflows/release.yml, which is where this runs in practice,
# inside registry.fedoraproject.org/fedora:44 to match the toolchain
# test.yml already pins (gtk4 4.22, libadwaita 1.9; Fedora 43 and Ubuntu
# 24.04 are both older and fail three *-sys build scripts with a pkg-config
# hint that reads as a missing package rather than an old one).
#
# On a system where `dnf builddep` is not available or not wanted, install
# the packages packaging/rpm/cordial.spec's BuildRequires: block names, by
# hand, before running this.
