//! Open one web window through [`cordial_shell::webview::open`] and let it
//! report what the page got.
//!
//! Why this exists rather than a note in a document: the question "does this
//! machine's WebKitGTK do WebAuthn" is only answerable by asking a live page,
//! and the only web window Cordial ever opens is the one the engine asks for
//! through `openNativeOverlay` — which needs a signed-in client and a click,
//! neither of which an agent may produce here (AGENTS.md's caution on
//! synthesised input, and `docs/analysis/webview-surface.md` §6's "nobody has
//! observed a web-view request under Cordial"). So the capability line printed
//! by `open` was unobservable, on the exact code path where it matters most.
//!
//! This drives that same `open` — same `NetworkSession`, same
//! `UserContentManager`, same policy — with a URL given on the command line,
//! and quits. It signs in to nothing, types nothing, and stores nothing.
//!
//!     cargo run --release --features webview --example webauthn_probe \
//!         -- https://www.roblox.com/login
//!
//! The URL must pass `webview_policy::evaluate`, which means HTTPS on the
//! default port with no userinfo; anything else is refused before a view is
//! built, which is the policy working rather than the example failing.
