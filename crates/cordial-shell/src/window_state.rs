//! What state a window was left in, kept per profile.
//!
//! Two windows, two files, one shape: `<profile_dir>/window.json` for the
//! launcher and `<profile_dir>/game-window.json` for the one Roblox runs in.
//!
//! ## Why two files and not one
//!
//! A maximised launcher does not mean a maximised game window and never did.
//! They are different sizes for different jobs -- the launcher is a 540x340
//! chooser, the game window is whatever fills a monitor -- and one record would
//! make the last window closed decide how the next one opens. GNOME does not
//! share geometry between an application's windows either.
//!
//! ## What is remembered, and what GNOME says to remember
//!
//! Width, height, maximised, fullscreen. That is the whole of the set the HIG
//! names, and the *unmaximised* width and height at that: restoring a
//! maximised window means restoring the size it should return to when it is
//! unmaximised, not the size of the screen it was covering. GTK does that part
//! -- `gtk_window_get_default_size` reports the unmaximised size -- and the
//! save sites in `window.rs` decline to write at all while the window is
//! maximised or fullscreen, because both states report their own extent through
//! those same properties while a transition is in flight.
//!
//! ## Why per profile, not `shell.json`
//!
//! ADR-013 draws the line between the two config surfaces by what a setting
//! *is*, not by which directory it started in: appearance stays global because
//! it is application chrome, and everything that answers a question about one
//! account moves into the profile. A window preference argues for the profile
//! side of that line for the same reason the task that added this file was
//! given in the first place -- a fullscreen choice made while poking at a
//! throwaway profile must not silently follow the user onto the profile they
//! actually play on. That is exactly the grants-file argument ADR-013 makes at
//! length, applied to one more setting: an approval, or here a preference,
//! given in one profile answering a question about a different one.
//!
//! ## Placement, per ADR-013
//!
//! Same shape as `network.rs`'s own placement note: `window.json` lives beside
//! `flags.json`, `plugin-grants.json` and `network.json` inside the profile
//! directory rather than in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cordial/shell.json`. There is no
//! legacy file to migrate -- this setting did not exist anywhere before this
//! change -- so absence simply means [`WindowState::default`], windowed at
//! whatever size `window.rs` already asked for before this file existed.
//!
//! ## Why there is no saved position
//!
//! `host_window.rs`'s own `smallest_monitor` doc already says it: "Wayland
//! does not let a client choose, or even learn in advance, which output its
//! toplevel will be mapped on -- that is the compositor's decision". The
//! corollary is the same for *placing* a mapped toplevel: there is no
//! `xdg_toplevel` request that moves a window to a coordinate, on any
//! compositor, by design -- ADR-011 is the decision that put Cordial on
//! Wayland at all, and ADR-011 is explicit that the X11-only capabilities it
//! gave up are not coming back. A `WindowState` with an `(x, y)` in it would be
//! two fields this file could write and nothing could ever read back, which is
//! worse than not having them: a settings file that appears to remember
//! something it cannot is the "stub that returns success" AGENTS.md rules out,
//! wearing a config file instead of a function. So this remembers size only.
//!
//! ## The escape hatch, and why this file restores fullscreen unconditionally
//!
//! The risk named in this feature's task is real and specific: a launch that
//! comes up fullscreen with a broken renderer, or a display that no longer
//! exists, traps the user behind chrome they cannot get to. That risk is about
//! the *engine's* window -- black canvas, no frame, nothing to click -- and
//! this file does not restore fullscreen there. It cannot: `window.rs` builds
//! the shell's own launcher window, which is a `GtkDrawingArea` that paints
//! nothing behind libadwaita's own background (see `HostWindow::with_canvas`),
//! never an engine surface. There is no renderer in this window to break.
//!
//! So `window.rs` restores this state unconditionally, before the window is
//! shown, and that is safe specifically because F11 (`win.fullscreen`, wired
//! in the same function, before `present()`) and the compositor's own
//! fullscreen keybinding are both live from the first frame this window ever
//! draws -- there is no gap in which a fullscreen chooser window exists with
//! no way out.
//!
//! **That reasoning does not carry over to the engine's own window, and
//! whoever wires a saved preference there next must re-derive it rather than
//! copy this comment.** `android/wayland.rs` builds that window directly
//! against `HostWindow::with_canvas` (confirmed by reading it, not touched by
//! this change -- it is out of this task's scope) with no `GtkApplication` and
//! therefore no accelerator group at all: `set_accels_for_action` in
//! `window.rs` only works because this window's `set_application` call gives
//! it one. `docs/NEXT.md` §1e already documents that window's fullscreen path
//! as fragile even when driven deliberately, by test instrumentation, with a
//! developer watching. Restoring a saved fullscreen state into a window with
//! no confirmed keyboard escape and a documented history of fullscreen bugs,
//! right as the engine itself might be the thing that is broken, is precisely
//! the trap this task's brief warns against. It needs its own escape hatch
//! before it earns this file's default.
