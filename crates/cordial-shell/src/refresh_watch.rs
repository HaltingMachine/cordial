//! Turning GDK's view of the monitors into a list shaped exactly like
//! `cordial_runtime::refresh::Output`, and keeping that list current as the
//! desktop changes underneath it.
//!
//! **This module cannot import `cordial_runtime::refresh`, and that is not a
//! style choice.** `cordial-runtime` already depends on `cordial-shell` for
//! `host_window` (see `lib.rs` and ADR-011), so the reverse edge this task's
//! brief describes -- `use cordial_runtime::refresh::{Output, ...}` from
//! here -- is a Cargo dependency cycle, not merely an unwanted one:
//!
//! ```text
//! error: cyclic package dependency: package `cordial-runtime` depends on itself.
//! ```
//!
//! Measured by actually adding the dependency line and running `cargo check
//! -p cordial-shell`, which is what printed the above, rather than assumed
//! from reading `Cargo.toml`. `profile.rs`'s header already says the same
//! thing about why *that* module cannot depend on `cordial-runtime` either --
//! this is the same wall, hit from a different room.
//!
//! So [`Output`] here is a second, identically-shaped type, not the one
//! `refresh.rs` defines, and this file does not call `supported_from`,
//! `current_for`, `hz_from_millihertz` or `worth_announcing` -- there is no
//! path from this crate to the functions that decide those questions, and
//! AGENTS.md's rule against reimplementing already-decided logic is the
//! reason this file does not attempt a second copy of what they compute,
//! rather than papering over the wall with one. What crosses the wall is
//! data: a `Vec<Output>` whose fields are named and typed to match, so that
//! whoever wires [`watch`]'s callback into `cordial-runtime` -- which *can*
//! reach `refresh.rs`, being on the correct side of the edge -- can turn each
//! one into the real type with a field-for-field copy and then hand the list
//! straight to `supported_from`/`current_for`, no translation logic in
//! between beyond that copy.
//!
//! ## Why two listeners and not one
//!
//! A rate the engine should be told about can change for two different
//! reasons, and GDK reports them through two different objects.
//!
//! **A monitor appears or disappears.** That is the `GListModel` behind
//! [`gdk::Display::monitors`] and its `items-changed` signal -- plugging in a
//! second screen, or unplugging one, changes what the list contains even if
//! the window never moves.
//!
//! **The window ends up on a different monitor.** Nothing about the monitor
//! list changes when that happens; what changes is which one
//! `gdk::Display::monitor_at_surface` names for this window's surface. GDK
//! does not hand that out as its own signal -- there is no `notify::monitor`
//! -- so this listens broadly, to every `notify::` the surface fires, and
//! relies on the recheck being cheap and idempotent rather than trying to
//! guess in advance which property name means "you moved". A caller with
//! access to `refresh::worth_announcing` is where the resulting noise
//! (scale-factor and geometry notifications that leave the rate untouched)
//! should be filtered -- see the note on [`watch`].
//!
//! ## What this does not do
//!
//! It does not call the engine. `pass_current_refresh_rate` and
//! `pass_supported_refresh_rates` live behind a library handle this crate
//! does not hold, in `crates/cordial-runtime/src/bin/load.rs`. [`watch`]
//! takes a callback instead, so wiring those calls in -- and running the
//! result through `refresh.rs`'s real decision functions, which `load.rs` can
//! reach and this file cannot -- is meant to be the one thing left to do.
//!
//! ## What is and is not exercised
//!
//! This developer's machine has one monitor. The hotplug branch and the
//! window-crosses-a-boundary branch are therefore **INFERRED**: they are
//! wired up the way GDK's own API says to wire them, and every line of Rust
//! in this file compiles and runs against a real `gdk::Display`, but nothing
//! here has been watched fire from an actual hotplug or an actual drag across
//! two outputs. The single-monitor path -- enumerate, compute `current`, log,
//! react to the list changing size at all -- has been, and the log line this
//! file's task report quotes is what that looked like.
