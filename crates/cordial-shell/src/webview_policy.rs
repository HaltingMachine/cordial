//! What the in-experience web window is allowed to load, and what it is allowed
//! to talk to the engine about.
//!
//! Derived from mocktail's `webview_helper_policy.cc`, Copyright 2026
//! komaruworld, Apache-2.0 — see `NOTICE` and `third_party/mocktail-webview/`.
//! Rewritten in Rust against `glib::Uri` rather than translated line by line,
//! and the two rules below are theirs. Apache-2.0 section 4(b): this file is a
//! modified derivation and says so here.
//!
//! ## Why this is a separate module with no WebKit in it
//!
//! Because it is the part that has to be right. Everything else in a web window
//! is plumbing — if the header bar is wrong somebody notices and fixes it. If
//! this is wrong, a page the user did not expect gets to send commands to the
//! Roblox process, and nobody notices at all.
//!
//! `glib` comes through `gtk4`'s re-export rather than as a dependency of its
//! own: two glib versions in one process would be two sets of GObject type
//! registrations for the same C types, which is the same reasoning that pins
//! gtk4 across the workspace.
//!
//! Keeping it free of WebKit means it is testable without a browser engine,
//! without a display, and without the `webkitgtk6.0-devel` headers that the view
//! itself needs. The tests below run everywhere `cargo test` runs.
//!
//! ## The two rules
//!
//! They are separate on purpose, and the separation is the design:
//!
//! 1. **May this be loaded at all?** HTTPS, a real host, the default port, and
//!    *no userinfo component*.
//! 2. **May this page use the privileged bridge?** Only if rule 1 passed *and*
//!    the host is Roblox's.
//!
//! A page can pass the first and fail the second, and that is the common case —
//! a payment provider or an identity provider inside the checkout flow should
//! render, and should not be able to ask the engine for anything.
//!
//! The userinfo clause in rule 1 is the one that looks like a detail and is not.
//! `https://www.roblox.com@evil.example/` has host `evil.example`, and a reader
//! skimming the address sees Roblox. Rejecting any URI carrying userinfo removes
//! the ambiguity rather than trying to be clever about it.
