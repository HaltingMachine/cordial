//! One dropdown and one toggle, and why it is neither two dropdowns nor two
//! toggles.
//!
//! **Auto update** — update in the background, ask, or manual. **Download on
//! metered connection** — one switch.
//!
//! ## The two-dropdown shape this replaced, and why it went
//!
//! This module used to be two enums, and its header argued the case at length:
//! three controls that can each be set on their own produce combinations with no
//! defined meaning, and "update in the background, but never download" is a
//! setting that has to either lie or explain itself. That reasoning is kept here
//! rather than deleted, because it was not wrong — and because the shape that
//! followed it, a dropdown and *two* switches, did make that contradiction
//! reachable. Both connection switches off with Auto update on background could
//! never download anything, so the module named the state, the settings page
//! carried a warning row about it, and `may_download` reported it.
//!
//! ## And why the second switch went too
//!
//! All of that machinery existed because one question was being asked twice.
//! **There is no radio in this.** `org.freedesktop.NetworkManager`'s `Metered`
//! property is the only question [`crate::metered`] asks, and it is a statement
//! about who pays for the bytes rather than about the link layer. *Download on
//! Wi-Fi* governed the not-metered answer and *Download on metered connection*
//! governed the metered one — two names for one bit, with a switch labelled
//! Wi-Fi that an ordinary wired desktop was also governed by. Its own row in the
//! settings page had to explain that, which is a fair sign the label was wrong.
//!
//! Nobody turns Wi-Fi off while leaving metered on. So the question is asked
//! once, in the direction people have an opinion about: **may a download run
//! when the connection is metered?** Off holds the download until an unmetered
//! link turns up, which is what somebody on a data allowance wants; on stops the
//! connection being consulted at all.
//!
//! With one switch there is no combination that refuses forever, so the warning
//! row and [`DownloadOn::never_downloads`] are both gone. The contradiction the
//! original two-dropdown argument warned about is unreachable again — not by
//! forbidding it, but because it was an artefact of the duplicated question.
//!
//! [`UpdateSettings::plan`] is still total, which is the property every one of
//! these shapes was chosen for: every combination of the controls and every one
//! of NetworkManager's answers maps to exactly one [`Plan`], and
//! `every_setting_combination_has_exactly_one_plan` is the test that would have
//! to be told what a new control meant.
//!
//! ## A guess counts as metered
//!
//! NetworkManager answers with four values, two of which are guesses, and both
//! guesses are treated as metered. An ordinary desktop on a LAN answers
//! guess-no, so the default settings hold a download there — the switch is
//! reached far more often than "am I on a hotspot" suggests. Reading a guess as
//! cheap is how a data allowance pays for a 115 MB download nobody asked for,
//! and the cost of being wrong the other way is a button press.
//!
//! Nothing here is GTK. The shell binds an `AdwComboRow` to [`Automatic::index`],
//! the same seam `shell_config::AppearanceScheme` already uses, so the position
//! in the model is the one thing that has to agree between the two files rather
//! than a name-keyed lookup that can drift from the model's actual contents.
