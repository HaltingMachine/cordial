//! Roblox's release notes, so the header-bar button has something to show.
//!
//! The up-to-date state of that button is not a dead end — it shows the current
//! version and its changelog — so this is fetched whether or not there is an
//! update, and it is the half of the check that works for the Android build
//! today. See [`version`](crate::version) for why the other half does not.
//!
//! ## Where these come from, measured 2026-08-02
//!
//! Roblox posts them to the DevForum, which is Discourse, which serves every
//! page as JSON if you ask for `.json`:
//!
//! ```text
//! $ curl -sSL -w '%{http_code} %{url_effective}\n' \
//!     https://devforum.roblox.com/c/updates/release-notes.json
//! 200 https://devforum.roblox.com/c/updates/release-notes/62.json
//! → topic_list.topics[]: {"id":4763851,"slug":"release-notes-for-732",
//!                         "title":"Release Notes for 732",
//!                         "created_at":"2026-07-29T18:44:52.923Z"}
//! ```
//!
//! The slug URL is used rather than the numeric `62` it redirects to: a
//! category id is a database key and a slug is the thing Roblox would keep if
//! they reorganised. ureq follows the redirect.
//!
//! **A topic must be fetched by slug *and* id.** `/t/4763851.json` answers
//! **403**; `/t/release-notes-for-732/4763851.json` answers 200. That is not a
//! permission problem to work around, it is Discourse's routing, and it is
//! written down here because a 403 from a public forum reads like something
//! else entirely.
//!
//! ## The title carries the version
//!
//! Every entry is titled `Release Notes for NNN`, and `NNN` is the engine major
//! — the `732` in `0.732.23.7321040`, and the `Version=732` the client logs
//! about itself. That correspondence is what lets this be useful without the
//! version endpoint: the newest release-notes major is the newest engine Roblox
//! has shipped. Entries whose title carries no number — the category's own
//! "About the Release Notes category" pinned post — are dropped rather than
//! shown, since they are not releases.

// ------------------------------------------------- the Creator Hub docs table
//
// The DevForum post announces a release; it does not list what changed. Its body
// is five lines of "732 has landed, enjoy" and a set of links, one of which goes
// to the Creator Hub — so a window showing the post was showing the covering
// note and calling it a changelog.
//
// **This used to be keyed by the DevForum's engine number, and that was the
// bug.** `release-notes-<major>` was a real route once, but it answers a plain
// 404 now, and the version-keyed fallback this file grew in its place —
// looking three majors back for whichever one existed — was the wrong fix for
// the wrong problem: it kept the version arithmetic that was never the actual
// question. Reported exactly this way: "it shouldnt check the next release, it
// should find the latest release in roblox's release notes. Use their api using
// a browser and checking network requests, id rather a stable API than an
// unstable HTML."
//
// Measured on 2026-08-28 with a browser's own network panel:
//
//   - `create.roblox.com/docs/release-notes/release-notes-736` -> 404.
//     `-735` and `-734` -> 301, to `/docs/updates/2026-08-17` and
//     `/docs/updates/2026-08-10`. The old route is a legacy alias into the
//     replacement, not a route of its own any more.
//   - `create.roblox.com/docs/updates` -> 200, a Next.js page. Its
//     `__NEXT_DATA__` carries the *site's whole navigation tree* and zero
//     `ReleaseNotesText` entries — this is the index, not the content.
//   - That page's navigation lists the release pages Roblox itself keeps, and
//     names one of them for us: a "Release notes" section whose entries are
//     titled `Current release`, `Pending release`, and a `Recent releases`
//     list of `Week of <date>` pages. **"Current release" is the answer to the
//     complaint, by Roblox's own label** — no version comparison required.
//   - `.../_next/data/<buildId>/updates.json` answers with exactly that
//     navigation, as data, once `<buildId>` is known — Next.js's own
//     per-deploy id, stamped into the shell page's `__NEXT_DATA__` as
//     `"buildId":"..."` and changing on every Roblox deploy, which is why it
//     is read fresh each call rather than assumed.
//   - `.../_next/data/<buildId>/updates/2026-08-24.json` (the path the
//     navigation gave for "Current release") answers with clean JSON:
//     `pageProps.data.releaseNoteContents.content`, an array of
//     `{"ReleaseNotesText", "ReleaseNotesType", "Status"}` — the same three
//     fields the old HTML scrape parsed out of a `__NEXT_DATA__` script tag,
//     now the entire body of a JSON response with nothing else to strip away.
//
// **This is not a documented public API.** It is Next.js's own hydration data,
// and Roblox did not design it for outside callers. What makes it a fair trade
// against the HTML scrape it replaces is which parts are load-bearing: the
// `buildId` key and the `pageProps` envelope are the framework's own
// constants, no more Roblox's to rearrange than an HTTP header is, while what
// the old code parsed — the page's rendered markup — was entirely Roblox's
// content to change and did, twice, inside one release cycle.
