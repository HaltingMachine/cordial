//! The expensive half: getting the build onto the user's disk.
//!
//! This is the only part [`settings`](crate::settings) governs. Checking is one
//! small request and runs regardless; downloading is 115 MB and runs when the
//! user's settings and their connection both say it may.
//!
//! ## There is no Roblox-hosted URL for the Android build, and that is now
//! established rather than merely unfound
//!
//! ADR-015 permits fetching the official build *from Roblox's own distribution*.
//! This section used to say that no such URL "could be established", which reads
//! as an investigation that ran out of time and invites the next person to have
//! another go. The investigation has now been done, on 2026-08-03, and the
//! answer is that there is none — stated here strongly enough that nobody spends
//! another afternoon on it.
//!
//! Roblox's deployment CDN carries the desktop clients and nothing else.
//! [`DEPLOY_HISTORY`] answers 200 with 7210 lines of deployment records, whose
//! product names are `Studio`, `Studio64`, `WindowsPlayer`, `RccService`,
//! `Client`, `MFCStudio` and `StudioBeta`; the strings `android` and `apk` do
//! not occur in it once. [`ANDROID_DEPLOY_HISTORY`] answers 403 `AccessDenied`,
//! which is what that bucket says about a prefix it does not have.
//!
//! Roblox's own download page offers Android through Google Play and the Amazon
//! Appstore and links no file at all, and the `client-version` endpoint answers
//! HTTP 500 for `AndroidApp` ([`version`](crate::version) has that table). Three
//! separate places where a public Android artefact would surface if there were
//! one, and it is absent from all three, because Roblox ships the Android
//! application through app stores.
//!
//! ## What Sober does, since it was the project assumed to know
//!
//! This section used to say Sober "documents nothing about where it gets it".
//! Half of that was right and the useful half was wrong. Sober is closed source
//! — `vinegarhq/sober` holds a README, an icon and issue templates, and no code
//! — but it documents its distribution route plainly, in its own licence and
//! privacy notices, and those say it goes to the app store:
//!
//! Sober does not redistribute the APK. Its optional Automatic Downloads
//! feature asks VinegarHQ's own servers for a **Google Play** link, and the
//! bundle comes from Google Play on the user's own account, after the user opted
//! in during onboarding. VinegarHQ's one open-source component that touches the
//! Android build, the `custard` deployment tracker, does not use a Roblox
//! endpoint either: it watches `com.roblox.client` on Aptoide, a third-party APK
//! mirror, and it queries `client-version` only for `WindowsPlayer` and
//! `WindowsStudio64`. That is independent corroboration of the 500 above, from
//! the project that would most like it to answer.
//!
//! So the one project known to obtain this file had not found a Roblox URL. It
//! went to the store Roblox put the file in.
//!
//! ## Why neither of Sober's two routes is available here
//!
//! Fetching from Google Play means holding the user's Google credentials and
//! speaking the Play protocol as a registered device. ADR-015 permits fetching
//! from Roblox's own distribution, and a store account is not that; a Cordial
//! that asked for a Google password would be a different program from the one
//! that ADR was written about.
//!
//! A mirror looked worse rather than easier, and this paragraph used to end the
//! argument there. **Half of it was right and the half that decided the outcome
//! was wrong**, so it is corrected here rather than quietly dropped.
//!
//! What was right: an MD5 supplied by the mirror alongside the file is not a
//! check, it is the mirror agreeing with itself, and a fetcher resting on one
//! has no protection at all against the party it is protecting itself from.
//! That still holds and nothing in this crate relies on a provider-supplied
//! hash.
//!
//! What was wrong: that this left no way to make a mirror safe. Roblox signs
//! its own APKs, the signature covers every byte of the archive, and the
//! signing certificate is not something a mirror can forge. So the check that
//! the mirror cannot fake is not a hash it hands over -- it is the one already
//! inside the file. [`crate::apk_signature`] performs it and
//! [`crate::provider`] is the fetcher built on it, permitted by
//! [ADR-025](../../../docs/adr/ADR-025-fetching-from-a-third-party-mirror.md).
//!
//! Measured on 2026-08-26: the archive APKPure serves for 2.734.917 and the
//! archive Sober downloaded from Google Play are different files -- 229 MB of
//! every ABI against 97 MB of assets plus a 53 MB x86-64 split -- and both
//! verify against the same Roblox signing certificate. That is the thing the
//! old paragraph assumed could not be established.
//!
//! So there is no constant here holding a URL, guessed or borrowed.
//! [`Source::official`] refuses — in three plain sentences, with all of the
//! above left here as reasoning rather than said to a player — and
//! [`Parts::configured`] takes URLs and hashes from the environment for a user
//! who has chosen a location themselves. If Roblox ever publishes an Android
//! deployment path, [`Source::official`] is the one function to fill in and
//! nothing else here changes.
//!
//! **Re-measured 2026-08-20**: the desktop history answers 200 with 7230 lines
//! and still no `android` or `apk` anywhere in it, and the Android prefix is
//! still 403. Two measurements seventeen days apart, one of them with the
//! control moving (7210 lines to 7230), which is what tells the two apart from
//! one cached answer read twice.
//!
//! ## A build is two files
//!
//! [`Parts`] is here because "the APK" is not one thing. `base.apk` has the
//! assets and **no engine**; `split_config.x86_64.apk` has `libroblox.so`. A
//! fetcher that takes one URL takes the half that cannot start, and this project
//! has walked into that more than once. [`crate::install`] is where the pair is
//! checked against what actually arrived rather than against its file names.
//!
//! ## What is checked, and when
//!
//! The scheme must be `https`. ADR-014 rejects a `file:` or plain-HTTP download
//! URL for the same reason: the hash is what makes a download trustworthy, so
//! the scheme is defence in depth rather than the guarantee, but a URL is the
//! one field a fetcher acts on and the set of schemes it can be talked into is
//! worth being a short list.
//!
//! The size is capped as it streams, not afterwards and not from the
//! `Content-Length` header, which is whatever the server felt like sending.
//!
//! The hash is computed over the stream and checked **before the file is given
//! the name anything else looks for**. ADR-014 hashes a plugin archive in memory
//! before a byte is written, and that is not available here — a 115 MB APK held
//! whole to check it is 115 MB of resident memory on a machine that is about to
//! run a game engine. The equivalent is a `.partial` staging file: nothing reads
//! it, [`crate::apk`] is never pointed at it, and it is removed on any refusal.
//! What ADR-014's rule protects against is a tampered archive that has already
//! been parsed and unpacked, and that cannot happen here, because unpacking
//! takes a path this function only produces after the digest matches.
