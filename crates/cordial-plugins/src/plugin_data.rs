//! What a plugin leaves behind in a profile when its files are removed.
//!
//! Uninstalling deletes the plugin: its manifest, its entry module, its assets,
//! and the flag layer it wrote, because all of those live inside its installed
//! directory and `unpack::uninstall` removes that whole. **None of that is
//! data.** The data is what the *profile* remembers about the plugin — the
//! settings somebody chose, the capabilities they allowed, and whether they had
//! switched it off — and that is deliberately kept, so reinstalling picks up
//! where it left off.
//!
//! Kept is the right default and occasionally the wrong answer, which is what
//! this module is for: it measures what is being kept so the Remove dialog can
//! offer to delete it and say how much, and it deletes the lot in one place so
//! no caller has to know that grants and enablement live in shared documents
//! while settings get a directory of their own.
//!
//! The three locations, and why they are not one:
//!
//! ```text
//! <profile>/plugins/<id>/         settings.json and anything else it saved
//! <profile>/plugin-grants.json    one entry, keyed by id
//! <profile>/plugin-enabled.json   one entry, and only when switched off
//! ```
//!
//! Only the first has a size worth quoting. The other two are single entries
//! inside documents shared by every plugin, so removing one frees a line rather
//! than a measurable quantity of disk -- which is why [`Footprint::bytes`] is
//! the directory alone and [`Footprint::is_empty`] is not `bytes == 0`. A
//! plugin that was granted a capability and never wrote a setting has data to
//! delete and occupies nothing, and offering no checkbox for it would be
//! wrong.
