//! `notify.send` — a desktop notification through the freedesktop portal.

//! Cordial owns the D-Bus connection; the plugin sends a summary and a body
//! and nothing else. Going through `org.freedesktop.portal.Notification`
//! rather than talking to `org.freedesktop.Notifications` directly matters
//! for the Flatpak build specifically: portal interfaces are reachable from
//! inside the sandbox without any `--talk-name` entry, because the portal is
//! the door Flatpak already leaves open, whereas the notification daemon's
//! own bus name is not. That keeps this capability's cost in
//! `org.cordial.Cordial.yml` at zero rather than one more narrow-but-present
//! permission — see ADR-007 on keeping the manifest's entries few and
//! specific.
