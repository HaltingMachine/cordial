//! What a plugin declares it wants asked, and the answers Cordial keeps.
//!
//! A plugin cannot draw. It runs in its own process with no display, no
//! toolkit and no handle on anything Cordial has on screen (ADR-003), so the
//! GNOME Shell arrangement — where an extension opens a window and builds it
//! itself — is not available even in principle. What is available is the shape
//! ADR-007 already uses everywhere else: the plugin describes what it wants and
//! Cordial performs it. Here the effect is a preferences page.
//!
//! So a plugin declares fields in its `plugin.json` and Cordial renders an
//! `AdwPreferencesPage` from the declaration. The page looks native because it
//! *is* native, built by the launcher out of the same rows every other page in
//! Settings uses. See
//! [ADR-020](../../../docs/adr/ADR-020-declarative-plugin-preferences.md).
//!
//! ```json
//! {
//!   "id": "example",
//!   "entry": "main.ts",
//!   "preferences": [
//!     { "key": "loud", "type": "bool", "title": "Be loud", "default": false },
//!     { "key": "level", "type": "int", "title": "Level", "default": 3,
//!       "minimum": 1, "maximum": 10, "group": "Tuning" }
//!   ]
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! **The declaration is the signal.** There is no `has-preferences` manifest key
//! and no capability meaning "I have a settings page", because two facts that
//! can disagree eventually do: a plugin would ship the key and no fields, or
//! fields and no key, and one of those shows the user a gear that opens nothing.
//! A plugin has a page exactly when it declares at least one field, which cannot
//! be wrong about itself.
//!
//! **Cordial owns the answers, and this is a different document from
//! `settings.json`.** [`crate::settings`] holds what a plugin chooses to
//! remember, and the plugin is its only writer — `settings.set` replaces it
//! whole, which is right for scratch state and fatal for anything a user typed.
//! Two writers of one document, one of whom replaces it wholesale, loses the
//! user's answers the first time the plugin saves anything. So preferences live
//! beside it at `<profile>/plugins/<id>/preferences.json`, Cordial is the only
//! writer, and there is deliberately no `preferences.set` for a plugin to call.
//! A plugin that could rewrite its own preference values could set them to
//! whatever it liked and the page would show the plugin's choice back to the
//! user as though they had made it.
//!
//! Per profile for the reason everything else in ADR-013 is: the same installed
//! plugin, tuned one way on a test account and another way on the account
//! somebody plays, must not carry one profile's answers into the other.
