//! Everything Cordial did not answer, in one place.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! Cordial answers the Android platform for an engine that assumes Android is
//! there. When it does not have an answer, the gap shows up in four unrelated
//! places and three different formats: a generated libc stub returning zero, a
//! JNI class or method libjnivm has never heard of, an AGDK native the engine
//! called before it was registered, and a framework method here that returns a
//! placeholder because nobody has written the real thing yet.
//!
//! Each of those was already reported somewhere. None of them were reported
//! *together*, which is the form the question actually takes: **the client did
//! something wrong — what did we fail to tell it?** Answering that meant
//! grepping four kinds of line out of a log that also contains the engine's own
//! narration, and the fourth kind mostly did not exist.
//!
//! ## What it does not tell you
//!
//! **A gap listed here is not a cause.** This is a list of questions Cordial
//! answered badly or not at all; which one mattered is a separate investigation,
//! and this project's own history is largely of confident answers to that
//! question being wrong. The report is a work queue and a starting point for
//! bisecting, not a diagnosis.
//!
//! It is also **not a list of everything unimplemented** — only of what was
//! reached on that run. Something never called is never recorded, which is the
//! right behaviour for a report meant to be read after a failure, and the wrong
//! one for auditing coverage. Two runs that fail differently will list different
//! things.
//!
//! ## Where it goes
//!
//! Both stdout and a file beside the engine's own logs, because the two get read
//! in different situations: stdout when somebody is running the client from a
//! terminal, the file when they launched from the shell and are attaching
//! something to an issue afterwards. The file is overwritten each run — it
//! describes the run that just ended, and a growing file nobody trims is a file
//! nobody opens.
