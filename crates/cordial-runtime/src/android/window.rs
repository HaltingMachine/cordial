//! A host window, and `ANativeWindow_*` over it.
//!
//! Android hands the engine an `ANativeWindow` and it renders into that. On
//! Linux the equivalent is a window-system surface, so this creates one and
//! implements the ten `ANativeWindow_*` entry points Roblox imports against it.
//!
//! X11 is loaded with `dlopen` rather than linked. Cordial has to run its loader
//! and asset tests on machines with no display at all — CI, containers, a remote
//! shell — and a link-time dependency would make the whole binary refuse to
//! start there. Loading late means "no window" is a runtime condition the caller
//! can handle, which is what it actually is.
//!
//! Wayland is the better long-term target and Roblox's Android build has no
//! opinion either way. X11 first because `eglCreateWindowSurface` takes an
//! `xcb_window_t`/`Window` directly, whereas Wayland needs an `wl_egl_window`
//! and a surface role — more moving parts for the same first frame.

// and `onKeyDownNative`/`onKeyUpNative` — via `cordial-linker-sys`'s
// `game_activity` module and the synthesised `MotionEvent`/`KeyEvent` objects in
// `native/game_activity.cpp`.
//
// The design constraint is that this must never block: it runs inside
// `looper::pump`'s own ~50ms-timeout loop, on the thread that also owns the
// engine's message pump, so any call here that waits is a frame the engine
// never gets to render. `XPending`/`XNextEvent` are what actually read queued
// events, but calling either when nothing is queued risks a blocking read in
// at least some libX11 builds. So every drain starts with a zero-timeout
// `poll(2)` on Xlib's own connection fd (`XConnectionNumber`) — a pure
// kernel-side check that can only return immediately — and only touches Xlib
// at all when that says there is something to read.

/// that request is what produces the ~1 fps GLES fallback: measured directly
/// (wrapping `eglSwapBuffers` with a timer around the real call), every swap
/// blocks for 0.97-1.00s, not the ~16ms a 60Hz vblank wait should take. That
/// number is too round to be a real refresh interval and stayed exactly 1.00s
/// whether or not the window had input focus (`_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW` sent by
/// hand made no difference — focus was already ruled out at the Android level
/// separately). Setting the Mesa debug knob `vblank_mode=0` in the process
/// environment makes the block disappear entirely (swaps return in under a
/// millisecond), which isolates the cause to Mesa's DRI3/Present vblank wait,
/// not to Cordial's window, the compositor, or the engine's own pacing.
///
/// The reachable explanation: this host's X server is Xwayland (rootless,
/// under Mutter), which does not own a CRTC and cannot answer DRI3's
/// `GetMSC`/`Present` vblank queries the way a real Xorg/DRM master would.
/// When Mesa's `loader_dri3` can't get real MSC/vblank data it falls back to
/// pacing swaps against a synthetic interval rather than failing outright —
/// on this host that fallback lands on exactly 1 Hz. Vulkan's presentation
/// engine does not go through this code path at all (its own WSI, not GLX/
/// EGL's DRI3 loader), which is why the same host presents at a steady ~27
/// fps over `vkQueuePresentKHR` while GLES stalls on `eglSwapBuffers`.
///
/// Rather than exporting the Mesa env var — which would blanket-disable vsync
/// for every GL/EGL user in the process, including the diagnostic probes in
/// `gl.rs` — the fix is scoped to exactly the call the engine makes: force
/// the interval Mesa actually receives to 0. `eglSwapBuffers` then returns as
/// soon as the frame is submitted instead of waiting on a vblank source this
/// host cannot supply. The engine still paces itself (its own `RenderJob`
/// timing, the same mechanism that limits the Vulkan path to ~27 fps rather
/// than an unthrottled spin), so this does not hand the engine a runaway
/// framerate — it removes an extra, broken 1-Hz throttle underneath that
/// pacing, on top of it.
