//! Display-server-independent input plumbing, shared by [`super::window`] (X11)
//! and [`super::wayland`].
//!
//! X11 delivers keysyms directly. Wayland delivers raw evdev keycodes plus an
//! xkb keymap the client has to interpret itself — see ADR-011. Everything
//! *below* that difference is identical: both backends end up with a keysym, a
//! button number, or committed text, and from there the two paths converge.
//! This module is that convergence point. It used to live inside `window.rs`,
//! written for the only backend that existed; the text-entry state machine in
//! particular (`TextField`, the caret arithmetic, the reseed-on-focus-change
//! logic) took real iteration to get right — see the tests below — and a
//! second display backend is exactly the situation duplicating it would have
//! caused a second, silently-diverging copy of the same bugs to be fixed twice.
//!
//! What stays behind in each backend is the part that is genuinely
//! display-specific: opening a connection, reading its events, and turning
//! them into the keysym/button/text vocabulary this module speaks.
