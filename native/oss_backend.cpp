//! Open Sound System output, for the machines that have nothing else.
//!
//! ADR-023 scheduled OSS behind PulseAudio and ALSA and said, at the time
//! honestly, that it was "an answer to nothing" -- Linux has not shipped OSS as
//! its sound layer since ALSA replaced it, and the surviving users are on
//! FreeBSD, which Cordial does not run on. It was written up as the thing to
//! build if somebody arrived with the hardware and the appetite.
//!
//! Somebody asked. So it exists, and the reasoning that deferred it is left in
//! ADR-023 rather than quietly deleted, because "nobody needs this" turned out
//! to be a claim about who had spoken up rather than about who was there.
//!
//! ## It is the simplest backend here, and that is the point
//!
//! There is no client library to `dlopen`, no server to connect to, no node
//! graph and no registry. `/dev/dsp` is a file: three `ioctl`s to agree a
//! format, then `write()`. That means it works on a system with no sound
//! daemon at all, which is exactly the case the other three backends cannot
//! serve -- PipeWire and PulseAudio both need something running, and ALSA needs
//! a configured `default` PCM.
//!
//! It also means the device is **exclusive on most drivers**: while Cordial
//! holds `/dev/dsp`, nothing else on the machine gets sound. That is not a bug
//! to work around, it is what the interface is, and it is why this is opt-in
//! behind `CORDIAL_AUDIO_HOST=oss` and will not be selected for anybody who did
//! not ask.
//!
//! ## The write is the clock
//!
//! `write()` blocking when the device's buffer is full *is* the pacing, exactly
//! as `snd_pcm_writei` is for ALSA. There is no callback to wait for and no
//! sleep to tune, which is why the loop below has neither. Everything reachable
//! from `fill_` obeys `pipewire_backend.h`'s realtime rule -- no lock, no
//! allocation, no logging -- and the buffer is sized once in `open` for that
//! reason.
//!
//! ## Format
//!
//! OSS speaks integer PCM. `AFMT_S16_NE` is the one format every OSS
//! implementation worth targeting supports, so the engine's float frames are
//! converted on the way out rather than negotiated over. The conversion is a
//! multiply and a clamp per sample, on the audio thread, which is arithmetic
//! and allocates nothing.
